# Project 1 - Periodic Table API
## PeriodicTableDB
    This is a Back end Web App made in .NET to help users observe and study the various elements on the periodic table.

## Project Members
    Joseph Savage

## Project Requirements
    README that describes the application and its functionalities
    ERD of your DB
    The application should be ASP.NET Core application
    The application should build and run
    The application should have unit tests and at least 20% coverage (at least 5 unit tests that tests 5 different methods/functionality of your code)
    The application should communicate via HTTP(s) (Must have POST, GET, DELETE)
    The application should be RESTful API
    The application should persist data to a SQL Server DB
    The application should communicate to DB via EF Core (Entity Framework Core)

## Tech Stack
- ASP.NET (Web API Framework)
- C# (Back End Programming Language)
- EF Core (ORM Tech)
- SQL Server (Azure Hosted)
- Xunit.NET (testing unit tool)

## User Stories
    Users can view any element on the periodic table.
    Users can view any element on the periodic table with a boiling point within a given range.
    Users can view any element on the periodic table with a melting point within a given range.
    Users can view any element on the periodic table with an atomic mass within a given range.
    Users can view what group an element or elements are part of (i.e., alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, etc.).
    Users can view any element on the periodic table of a given state (solid, liquid, or gas).
    Users can view any people/organization that discovered an element.

## MVP Goals
    Users can update data for elements on the periodic table.
    Users can create brand new elements on the periodic table.
    Users can add more people who discovered elements on the periodic table.

## Stretch Goals
    Users can view isotopes for elements on the periodic table
    Users can view allotropes for elements on the periodic table
